# AutoChess is a project that I have created in an attempt to build a simple game that allows a 
player to play chess against a simple bot that I built entirely on my own without consulting any
resources or external libraries. The mission of this project was to create a rudimentary chess bot
to use as a benchmark of my abilities in building a simple bot after my first year of UCSD CS, 
against which I can measure my skills after taking more advanced CSE courses.  

This project consists of a simple text-based frontend and a backend containing functions for 
debugging, saving and loading games, and running the rudimentary bot, which I have taken to 
calling Reggie.
